#  &#9760; Welcome to Gekido's Lair &#9760;

I'm an indie game dev and real time animation producer. My day job currently is as Technical Director at Cloudhead Games, leading a 20+ person engineering team working on next gen VR titles. I'm also the founder & CTO at Megacrush (https://www.megacru.sh) where I'm leading the studio in our development & tech efforts. Previously, I worked at Unity for 7 years and had the luck of working on some awesome projects, including the collaboration with Oats Studios (for Adam Episode 2 / 3), Sherman and the Baymax Dreams projects with Disney TVA (which was awarded a technical Emmy in 2018).

Over my career I've been involved in a number of startups, growing studios from 0-100+ and up numerous times, and at Unity I've run production teams and produced dozens of Keynote demos and talks over the years. 

My background is about as raw 'indie gamedev' as they come - I'm a self-taught coder, artist, video producer, audio engineer, you name it.  I spend most of my time working in Unity these days, but still hack web pages, server-side code, run my own Package Registry for internal packages and much more. 

My official CV is about as complete as it gets over on LinkedIn:

I spend most of my coding working on side projects under the 'Pixel Wizards' tag - you can check out some of the OpenUPM Unity packages that I maintain over there.

I've written a number of posts on the Unity blog as well about various topics, but Unity fubar'd their blog so they're all lost to the ether.
