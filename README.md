#  &#9760; Welcome to Gekido's Lair &#9760;

I'm an indie game dev and real time animation producer. I've been working for Unity for the past 4 years or so and have had the luck of working on some awesome projects, including the collaboration with Oats Studios (for Adam Episode 2 / 3), Sherman and the Baymax Dreams projects with Disney TVA (which was awarded a technical Emmy in 2018).

Over my career I've been involved in a number of startups, growing studios from 0-60 and up multiple times, and at Unity I've run production teams and produced dozens of Keynote demos and talks over the years. 

My background is about as raw 'indie gamedev' as they come - I'm a self-taught coder, artist, video producer, audio engineer, you name it.  I spend most of my time working in Unity these days, but still hack web pages, server-side code, run my own Package Registry for internal packages and much more. 

My official CV is about as complete as it gets over on LinkedIn:

## ðŸ‘¯ Pixel Wizards ##

I spend most of my coding working on side projects under the 'Pixel Wizards' tag - you can check out some of the OpenUPM Unity packages that I maintain over there.
